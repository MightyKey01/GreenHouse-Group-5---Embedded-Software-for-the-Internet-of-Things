# GreenHouse Group 5 - Embedded Software for the Internet of Things

Our main idea was to build something that interact a lot with the stream of data that the world can give. So we thought about what need a lot of attentions and can be understood by a machine… the answer is plants! 
Take care of plants sometimes can be hard but we think that with the help of computers and sensors even the worst can do it. So why don’t build a greenhouse that gives you all the informations that you need to make growth healthy your plants.
Our automaic greenhouse code implements a few sensor:
- Light (TSL2561)
- Soil Humidity (4260581553784AzDelivery)
- Air Humidity and Temperature (DHT11)
- Water Level (HW038)

We also implement an interface to a Wi-Fi module (ESP82666) so we are able to comunicate with a TelegramBot and so ask information about our plants everytime and everywhere we want.

Project build using Arduino.
